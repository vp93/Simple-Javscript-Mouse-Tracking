      <p class="surprised">User psychology lesson #1 : Curiosity.  
<span>
  
 Do not reveal your most important and valuable information at first glance. The first glance is always lacking, and will most definetely not carry with it the sense of appreciation and focus that is required to value your product to the fullest. Reveal this information when user has shown explicit interest ( by clicking a button, hovering over a section etc .)
          </span></p>
   
   <p class="sad">User psychology lesson #2 : Feelings.
<span>
  Play with their feelings. Don't worry, this wont make you a bad person.
People like to be emotionally engaged with the content that they are viewing. A little sense of guilt while leaving a page ( especially when that page contains a payment section ) or even a sense of 'missing out' are strong factors affecting conversion-rates in today's age and thus are perfectly acceptable feelings to subject your viewers to.
          </span></p>
   
   
        <p class="home">User psychology lesson #3 : Pro-activeness.
<span>
  
 Once a user has demonstrated interest in a product through the use of explicit action ( clicking a 'pay' button, signing up for a newsletter etc) be pro-active in showing your appreciation by means of providing as much value as you can for their money and time. Providing free goods/services, membership extensions, and even a thank-you note goes a long way.
